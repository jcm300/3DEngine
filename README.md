# 3D Engine

Project developed in the context of the Computer Graphics course at **Universidade do Minho**.
The project consists of the implementation of a 3D engine using [**OpenGL**](https://www.opengl.org/about/) and [**freeGLUT**](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/). The 3D engine
takes an XML file as input and renders the scene specified by the file.
